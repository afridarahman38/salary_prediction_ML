# Salary Prediction using Machine Learning and Data Mining

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting salaries using machine learning and data mining techniques. By analyzing various factors such as education, experience, location, and industry, the goal is to build predictive models that can accurately estimate salary ranges for different job positions.

## Key Objectives
**Data Collection:** Gather relevant datasets containing information about job positions, salaries, and related features such as education level, years of experience, skills, etc.

**Data Preprocessing:** Clean and preprocess the collected data by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and performing feature scaling or normalization as necessary.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Analyze the dataset to identify patterns, correlations, and insights that may influence salary prediction. Visualize the data to understand distributions and relationships between variables.

**Feature Engineering:** Extract or create new features from existing ones to improve the predictive power of the models. This may involve feature selection, transformation, or combination.

**Model Building:** Train and evaluate different machine learning models such as linear regression, decision trees, random forests, support vector machines (SVM), or gradient boosting algorithms for salary prediction.

**Model Evaluation:** Assess the performance of the trained models using appropriate evaluation metrics such as mean absolute error (MAE), root mean squared error (RMSE), or coefficient of determination (R-squared).

**Model Tuning:** Fine-tune hyperparameters and optimize model performance using techniques like cross-validation and grid search to find the best combination of parameters.

**Deployment:** Deploy the trained model into production or create an application interface for users to input their job-related information and receive salary predictions.

## Project Structure
**Data:** Contains datasets used for training and testing the models.

**Notebooks:** Jupyter notebooks documenting the step-by-step process of data preprocessing, EDA, feature engineering, model building, and evaluation.

**Scripts:** Python scripts for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment.

**Models:** Saved trained models for future use or deployment.

**Reports:** Documentation, presentations, and reports summarizing the project findings, methodologies, and results.
